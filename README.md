# Durak
Durak (*дурак* – fool) is a static site generator with its own templating system, that makes
automatization of burdensome tasks, such as updating article listings on a blog, easy.
An example blog can be found in the `examples/blog` directory. To see the HTML generated from
the example sources, use `durak examples/blog examples/blog_output` and open
`examples/blog_output/index.html` in a web browser.
